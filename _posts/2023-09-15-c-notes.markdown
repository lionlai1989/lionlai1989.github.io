There are two issues -- buffer overflow and integer overflow -- in the following two
functions. Can you identify the lines responsible for these problems?"

```c
int authenticate() {
    char input[8];
    char password[8] = "liebe";
    std::cout << "Enter password: ";
    std::cin >> input;
    if (std::strncmp(password, input, 8) == 0)
        std::cout << "Access granted\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Access denied\n";
    return 0;
}
int binary_search(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (right + left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target)
            left = mid + 1;
        else
            right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Introduction

This page records all the C-related notes, frequently asked questions and prgramming
assignments I've encountered over the years.

## Write a generic function to swap strings and arrays.

Implement a `swap` function such that the following code

```c
int main() {
    char *h = "hell";
    char *w = "world";
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);
    // swap(h, w)
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);

    char c[5] = { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };
    char d[3] = { '1', '2', '3' };
    print_array(c, 5);
    print_array(d, 3);
    // swap(c, d)
    print_array(c, 3);
    print_array(d, 5);

    return 0;
}
```

generates the output

```
hell world
world hell
a e i o u
1 2 3
1 2 3
a e i o u
```

First, this task is _impossible_ given
[the above example code](https://stackoverflow.com/q/77162452/2641038), because the
array `c` and `d` don't have the same size. Second, `h` and `w` are two pointers (a
pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.) while `c` and `d` are
two arrays. Pointers and arrays are **not the same thing**. Third, designing a generic
swap function to swap objects of any type is doable, but for the swap to be possible,
the objects **must have the same size**. Here is the correct implementation:

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void swap_memory(void *a, void *b, size_t n) {
    char *pa = a;
    char *pb = b;
    char *end_pa = pa + n;
    while (pa != end_pa) {
        char tmp = *pa;
        *pa = *pb;
        *pb = tmp;
        pa++;
        pb++;
    }
}

void print_array(const char *c, size_t size) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        printf("%c ", c[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // NOTE: `h` is a pointer to a constant character. It means that I can't use `h` to
    // modify the characters in the string it points to, but I can reassign `h` to point
    // to a different string. Now, what does `const char *const h = "hell";` mean?
    const char *h = "hell";
    const char *w = "world"; // NOTE: "hell" and "world" do not have the same length.
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);
    swap_memory(&h, &w, sizeof(char *)); // NOTE: 32-bit or 64-bit
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);

    char c[5] = { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };
    char d[5] = { '1', '2', '3' };
    print_array(c, 5);
    print_array(d, 3);
    swap_memory(c, d, 5); // or `(&c, &d, 5)`, doesn't matter.
    print_array(c, 3);
    print_array(d, 5);

    return 0;
}
```

## Create a function to print every elements in a 2D array.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void print_2d_array_subscript(int rows, int cols, int arr[rows][cols]);
void print_2d_array_offset(int *arr, int rows, int cols);
void print_2d_array_subscript(int rows, int cols, int arr[rows][cols]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            printf("%d ", arr[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
void print_2d_array_offset(int *arr, int rows, int cols) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *(arr + i*cols + j));
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main () {
    int arr[2][5] = {
        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
        {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
    };
    print_2d_array_offset(&arr[0][0], 2, 5);
    print_2d_array_subscript(2, 5, arr);
    return 0;
}
```

## Explain padding and alignment in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct _engineer {
    char *title;             /* ..00 */
    int age;      // 4 bytes /* ..08 */
    long salary;  // 8 bytes /* ..16 */
} Engineer;

typedef struct _manager {
    char *title;             /* ..00 */
    short age;   // 2 Bytes  /* ..08 */
    int salary;  // 4 bytes  /* ..12 */
} Manager;

#pragma pack(push,1)
typedef struct _sale {
    char *title;            /* ..00 */
    short age;   // 2 Bytes /* ..08 */
    int salary;  // 4 bytes /* ..10 */
} Sale;
#pragma pack(pop)

int main () {
    Engineer e;
    Manager m;
    Sale s;
    printf("Size of Engineer is %lu. e.title: %p. e.age: %p. e.salary: %p\n", sizeof(e), &e.title, &e.age, &e.salary);
    printf("Size of Manager is %lu. m.title: %p. m.age: %p. m.salary: %p\n", sizeof(m), &m.title, &m.age, &m.salary);
    printf("Size of Sale is %lu. s.title: %p. s.age: %p. s.salary: %p\n", sizeof(s), &s.title, &s.age, &s.salary);

    return 0;
}
```

shows the following output:

```
Size of Engineer is 24. e.title: 0x7ffc5cc97730. e.age: 0x7ffc5cc97738. e.salary: 0x7ffc5cc97740
Size of Manager is 16. m.title: 0x7ffc5cc97720. m.age: 0x7ffc5cc97728. m.salary: 0x7ffc5cc9772c
Size of Sale is 14. s.title: 0x7ffc5cc97712. s.age: 0x7ffc5cc9771a. s.salary: 0x7ffc5cc9771c
```

The observed differences in structure sizes are due to structure padding and alignment
in C. Typically, structures are padded to align their members with the largest member's
size (in byte). In all three cases, the biggest members are all 8 bytes (char \*). Thus
all elements will be padded according 8 bytes.

-   `Engineer` Structure: To ensure salary is aligned on 8 bytes, 4 bytes of padding are
    added after `age`.
-   `Manager` Structure: 2 bytes of padding are added after `age` so that the combined
    size of `age` and `salary` aligns on 8 bytes.
-   `Sale` Structure: Padding is explicitly disabled within its scope using
    `#pragma pack(1)`.

## Create 1-Diemensional Array of pointers.

```c
int* arr[5];
printf("`arr` is an array with five pointers, and each pointer points to an interger. The address of `arr` is %p.\n", arr);
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    *(arr+i) = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
    **(arr+i) = i;
}
printf("`arr+2` means the address of the 2-th (0-based, so it's actually the third) element in arr is %p.\n", arr+2);
printf("`*(arr+2)` means that the 2-th element, which is a pointer, points to an address %p.\n",*(arr+2));
printf("`**(arr+2)` means the integer which the 2-th pointer points to is %d.\n", **(arr+2));
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    free(*(arr+i));
}
```

The output is shown below and it's pretty standard. Please explain why there is a
difference of 16 between `arr+2` and `arr`.

```
`arr` is an array with five pointers, and each pointer points to an interger. The address of `arr` is 0x7ffe971ed070.
`arr+2` means the address of the 2-th (0-based, so it's actually the third) element in arr is 0x7ffe971ed080.
`*(arr+2)` means that the 2-th element, which is a pointer, points to an address 0x55ace4c866f0.
`**(arr+2)` means the integer which the 2-th pointer points to is 2.
```

## Explain memory layout of a process.

Here is the demonstration code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int uninit_global;
int init_global = 1000;

void allocate_memory(int **arr, int size, int value)
{
    int uninit_local1 = 302;
    int init_arr[3] = {0, 1, 2};
    int uninit_local2;
    printf("<allocate_memory>:\n");
    printf("%p: init_arr\n", &init_arr);
    printf("%p: uninit_local2\n", &uninit_local2);
    printf("%p: uninit_local1\n", &uninit_local1);

    printf("%p: address of parameter `arr`\n", &arr);
    printf("%p: address of parameter `size`\n", &size);
    printf("%p: address of parameter `value`\n", &value);
    printf("\ncalling `malloc()` to allocate memory to `arr`\n");
    printf("\n===== End of Stack =====\n\n");
    printf("{Stack and Heap are growing toward each other.}\n\n");
    printf("===== End of Heap =====\n\n");

    *arr = (int *) malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    printf("%p: returned address of `malloc()`.\n", *arr);
    printf("\n");
    printf("===== Start of Heap =====\n");
}

int main () {
    int uninit_local1;
    int init_local = 302;
    int uninit_local2;

    static int static_init_local = 2380;
    static int static_uninit_local;

    printf("Here is the memory layout of a process\n\n");
    printf("===== Start of Stack =====\n\n");
    printf("<main>:\n");
    int later_defined = 10;
    int *later_defined_ptr = NULL;
    printf("%p: later_defined_ptr's address\n", &later_defined_ptr);
    printf("%p: later_defined's address\n", &later_defined);
    printf("%p: uninitialized local variable 2\n", &uninit_local2);
    printf("%p: initialized local variable\n", &init_local);
    printf("%p: uninitialized local variable 1\n", &uninit_local1);

    printf("\nCalling `allocate_memory()` function.\n");
    allocate_memory(&later_defined_ptr, 5, 45);
    printf("\n===== End of Uninitialized Data (global and static) (bss) =====\n\n");
    printf("%p: uninitialized global variable\n", &uninit_global);
    printf("%p: static uninitialized local variable\n", &static_uninit_local);
    printf("\n===== Start of Uninitialized Data (bss) =====\n");
    printf("\n===== End of Initialized Data =====\n\n");
    printf("%p: static initialized local variable\n", &static_init_local);
    printf("%p: initialized global variable\n", &init_global);
    printf("\n===== Start of Initialized Data =====\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The output message is shown below. Please explain why it looks like this.

```

## How to reverse byte orders from `0x12345678` to `0x78563412`?

-   Use `memcpy`:

```c
#include <stdint.h> // uint32_t, uint8_t
#include <stdio.h>  // printf
#include <stdlib.h> // malloc
#include <string.h> // memecpy

void reverse_byte_order(void *data, uint32_t num_bytes) {
    // malloc(num_bytes). calloc(num_elements, sizeof(element))
    // num_bytes = num_elements * sizeof(element)
    void *dest = malloc(num_bytes);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_bytes; ++i) {
        memcpy(dest + num_bytes - i - 1, data + i, 1);
    }
    memcpy(data, dest, num_bytes);
    free(dest);
}

int main() {
    uint32_t data1 = 0x12345678;
    printf("0x%08x\n", data1);
    reverse_byte_order(&data1, 4);
    printf("0x%08x\n", data1);

    uint32_t data2 = 0xabcdef;
    printf("0x%08x\n", data2);
    reverse_byte_order(&data2, 3);
    printf("0x%08x\n", data2);

    return 0;
}
```

-   Without using additional memory:

```c
void reverse_byte_order(void *data, uint32_t num_bytes) {
    uint8_t *start = data;
    uint8_t *end = data + num_bytes - 1;

    while (start < end) {
        // Swap the bytes pointed to by 'start' and 'end'.
        uint8_t temp = *start;
        *start = *end;
        *end = temp;

        // Move the pointers toward each other.
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

## What's the difference between `i++` and `++i`?

`i++` is known as post increment whereas `++i` is called pre increment. `++i` will
increment the value of `i`, and then return the incremented value. `i++` will increment
the value of `i`, but return the original value that `i` held before being incremented.
E.g., The following C snippet

```c
int j = 1, k = 0;
j = k++;
printf("j = %d, k = %d\n", j ,k);
j = ++k;
printf("j = %d, k = %d\n", j ,k);
```

creates the output below.

```shell
j = 0, k = 1
j = 2, k = 2
```

Let's look at some assembly code to verify that.

```c
// test.c
#include <stdio.h>
void foo() {
    int a, b;
    a = 1;

    // use one of these five at a time
    // b = a++;
    // b = ++a;
    // b = (a += 1);
    // b = (a = a + 1);
    // b = a++ + ++a;
}

int main() {
    foo();
    return 0;
}
```

One thing to keep in mind is that when a stack frame is created , it's growing toward
lower memory address. And it's guaranteed that `&b` > `&a`. So in our example, the
address `rbp-0x4` points to the variable `b` while `rbp-0x8` points to `a`. Thus, the
assignment `a = 1;` is always translated to `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1`. Now we are
ready to dive into the assembly.

-   In the case of `b = a++;`, it has the following assembly code

    ```
    $ gcc test.c && objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A10 foo.:
    0000000000001129 <foo>:
      112d:	55                   	push   rbp
      112e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
      1131:	c7 45 f8 01 00 00 00 	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1138:	8b 45 f8             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      113b:	8d 50 01             	lea    edx,[rax+0x1]
      113e:	89 55 f8             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],edx
      1141:	89 45 fc             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
      1144:	90                   	nop
    ```

    -   First, `a++` is associated to

        ```
        mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
        lea    edx,[rax+0x1]
        ```

        which first moves the value of `a` into `eax` and then computes `a+1` and moves
        the result into `edx`.

    -   Second, it moves the value of `edx` into `a`.
    -   Last, it moves the value of `eax` into `b`. Thus, `a == 1` and `b == 0` before
        `foo` returns.

-   In the case of `b = ++a;`, `b = (a += 1);`, and `b = (a += 1);`, they have the
    following assembly code

    ```
    $ gcc test.c && objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A10 foo.:
    0000000000001129 <foo>:
      112d:	55                   	push   rbp
      112e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
      1131:	c7 45 f8 01 00 00 00 	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1138:	83 45 f8 01          	add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      113c:	8b 45 f8             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      113f:	89 45 fc             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
      1142:	90                   	nop
    ```

    -   First, `++a` is associated to

        ```
        add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
        mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
        ```

        which first adds `a` with 1 and moves `a` into `eax`.

    -   Second, it moves the value of `eax` into `b`. Thus, `a == 1` and `b == 1` before
        `foo` returns. As you can see, the assembly code is one line fewer than the
        previous case. I reckon that's why people are talking about using `++i` is more
        efficient in general.

-   Finally, in the case of `b = a++ + ++a;`, its assembly code is

    ```
    $ gcc test.c && objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A12 foo.:
    0000000000001129 <foo>:
      112d:	55                   	push   rbp
      112e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
      1131:	c7 45 f8 01 00 00 00 	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1138:	8b 45 f8             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      113b:	8d 50 01             	lea    edx,[rax+0x1]
      113e:	89 55 f8             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],edx
      1141:	83 45 f8 01          	add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1145:	8b 55 f8             	mov    edx,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      1148:	01 d0                	add    eax,edx
      114a:	89 45 fc             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
      114d:	90                   	nop
    ```

    which can be broken down as follow:

    -   `a` is first moved into `eax` (Ln. 1138), added with 1 and stored in `edx`.
    -   `edx` is moved to `a` (Ln. 113e), and it adds 1 to `a` (Ln. 1141).
    -   Next, `a` is moved into `edx`. and add `edx` to `eax`.
    -   Lastly, `eax` is moved to `b`. Thus, `a == 3` and `b == 4` before `foo` returns.
        To be honest, without looking into assembly code, I am not able to answer this
        question. Thus, please DO NOT write code like this. An "intuitive" way to think
        about this is the follow
        ```
        b = a++ + ++a;
        --> 1 + (1+1)
        --> a = 3 = 2+1
        --> b = 1 + 3
        ```
        Still, it's counter intuitive.
