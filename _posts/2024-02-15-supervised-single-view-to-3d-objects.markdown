3D reconstruction from a single view is very similar to the process through which we
recognize objects in the real world. When we look at a chair from one angle, we know it
is a chair and can intuitively _imagine_ what it would look like from other angles. It's
not like a chair viewed from one angle will look like an airplane from another angle.
That being said, if you were determined to design an airplane that looks like a chair
from a specific viewpoint, then everything in this post is inapplicable. ðŸ¤£

Work in progress.
