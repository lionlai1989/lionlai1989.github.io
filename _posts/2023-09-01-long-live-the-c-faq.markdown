There are two issues -- buffer overflow and integer overflow -- in the following two
functions. Can you identify the lines responsible for these problems?"

```c
int authenticate() {
    char input[8];
    char password[8] = "liebe";
    std::cout << "Enter password: ";
    std::cin >> input;
    if (std::strncmp(password, input, 8) == 0)
        std::cout << "Access granted\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Access denied\n";
    return 0;
}
int binary_search(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (right + left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target)
            left = mid + 1;
        else
            right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Variable-Length Array (VLA) in C and C++

Read https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/variable-len-arr/

## Array of Characters and String Literal

`s1` is an **array** (not a pointer) of characters (_character arrays_) containing the
sequence "helloworld\0". The size of `s1` is determined by the number of characters in
the initializer, resulting in `sizeof(s1)` being 11 bytes. On the other hand, `s2` is a
**non-const pointer** pointing to the first character of the constant _string literals_
"helloworld\0" which is stored in read-only memory in C. The size of `s2` is 8 bytes on
a 64-bit system, representing the size of a pointer. `s3` is an array of characters with
a specified size of 10 bytes. The initializer "helloworld" contains 10 characters plus
the null terminator '\0', making it a total of 11 characters. Since `s3` is declared
with a size of 10 bytes, it is not large enough to accommodate the null terminator,
resulting in a potential buffer overflow. This code _might compile without any errors_,
but it is a source of
[**undefined behavior**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70798021/is-it-legal-to-read-into-an-array-that-doesnt-have-space-for-the-null-terminato?rq=3).

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char s1[] = "Helloworld";  // s1 is an `array` with a length of 11 bytes.
    char *s2 = "Helloworld";   // s2 is a non-const `pointer` pointing to a constant string literal.
    char s3[10] = "helloworld";// DO NOT EVER DO THIS. s3 is an `array` with a length of 10 bytes.

    printf("s1: %s. sizeof(s1): %ld\n", s1, sizeof(s1));
    printf("s2: %s. sizeof(s2): %ld\n", s2, sizeof(s2));
    printf("s3: %s. sizeof(s3): %ld\n", s3, sizeof(s3));
    printf("The 1st character of s1 is %c %c\n", *s1, s1[0]);
    printf("The 1st character of s2 is %c %c\n", *s2, s2[0]);
    printf("The 1st character of s3 is %c %c\n", *s3, s3[0]);
    printf("The 11th character of s1 is %c %d\n", *(s1+10), s1[10]);
    printf("The 11th character of s2 is %c %d\n", *(s2+10), s2[10]);
    printf("The 11th character of s3 is %c %d\n", *(s3+10), s3[10]);

    printf("\nModify s1 ...\n");
    s1[0] = 'h';   // Modifying the 1st character from 'H' to 'h'.
    printf("s1: %s. sizeof(s1): %ld\n", s1, sizeof(s1));

    printf("\nModify s3 ...\n");
    s3[0] = 'H';   // Modifying the 1st character from 'h' to 'H'.
    printf("s3: %s. sizeof(s3): %ld\n", s3, sizeof(s3));

    printf("\nModify s2 ...\n");
    s2[0] = 'H';  // Attempting to change the 1st character leads to a segmentation fault.
    printf("s2: %s. sizeof(s2): %ld\n", s2, sizeof(s2));
}
```

The output is the following:

```
s1: Helloworld. sizeof(s1): 11
s2: Helloworld. sizeof(s2): 8
s3: helloworldHelloworld. sizeof(s3): 10
The 1st character of s1 is H H
The 1st character of s2 is H H
The 1st character of s3 is h h
The 11th character of s1 is  0
The 11th character of s2 is  0
The 11th character of s3 is H 72

Modify s1 ...
s1: helloworld. sizeof(s1): 11

Modify s3 ...
s3: Helloworldhelloworld. sizeof(s3): 10

Modify s2 ...
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

There are few things to notice:

-   Printing characters from `s1`, `s2` and `s3` is done similarly. Both `*` and `[]`
    can be used to access elements in C-strings and arrays. However, it's crucial to
    recognize that `s1` and `s2` are fundamentally two different entities.

-   The size of the array `s3` is specified as 10 bytes, but the string "helloworld"
    requires 11 bytes (10 characters + null terminator \0). This will result in a buffer
    overflow, causing undefined behavior and potentially leading to unexpected issues in
    your program. **Don't ever do it.**

-   Attempting to modify the contents of `s1` is permissible because `s1` is an array,
    and arrays in C are mutable. In contrast, attempting to modify `s2` leads to a
    segmentation fault. This is because `s2` points to a read-only constant string
    literal, and modifying such literals in C results in a runtime error.

## How to tell if a system is little-endian or big-endian?

A big-endian system stores the most-significant byte (MSB) of a word at the smallest
memory address and the least-significant byte (LSB) at the largest. A little-endian
system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Also,
consider an integer `int n = 0x0A0B0C0D;`. In this case, `0A` represents the MSB, while
`0D` is the LSB. The _significance_ here refers to the influence a byte has on the value
of the integer. Changes to the most significant byte have a more significant impact on
the integer's value than changes to the least significant byte.

To better understand endianness, let's take a look at this visual representation:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/2023-09-01/32bit-Endianess.png" width="800">
  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #777;"></p>
  <i>Endian example.</i>
</div>

The endianness of a system can be determined using C code. The following code snippet
prints the byte values of an integer from the smallest memory address to the highest
address:

```c
int main(void) {
    int n = 0x0A0B0C0D;
    printf("Hexadecimal: 0x%08X\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(n); ++i) {
        printf("%p: %X\n", (void *)(char *)&n + i, *((char *)&n + i));
    }
}
```

In the code snippet, the expression `(char *)&n + i` is used to access individual bytes
of an integer `n`. The `(char *)&n` part treats the address of `n` as a pointer to a
character (byte), and then `+ i` is used to access each byte one by one within a loop.

```
Hexadecimal: 0x0A0B0C0D
0x7ffe4e964310: D
0x7ffe4e964311: C
0x7ffe4e964312: B
0x7ffe4e964313: A
```

It shows the least significant byte `0D` occupies the smallest address and the most
significant byte `0A` occupies the biggest. Thus, my system is a little-endian system.

## Convert a string representation of a signed integer into an integer.

The function below converts a string representation of a signed integer into an integer
while also addressing concerns related to integer overflow.

```c
#define MAXIMUM 127
#define MINIMUM -128

int str2int(const char *s, int *result) {
    assert(MAXIMUM / 10 == 12);
    assert(MAXIMUM % 10 == 7);
    assert(MINIMUM / 10 == -12);
    assert(MINIMUM % 10 == -8);

    while (*s == ' ' || *s == '\t') {
        s++;  // Skip leading white spaces
    }

    int sign = 0;
    if (*s == '-') {
        sign = -1;
        s += 1;
    } else {
        sign = 1;
    }

    int num = 0;
    while (*s != '\0') {
        if (*s >= '0' && *s <= '9') {
            int digit = (*s - '0');
            // It cannot check integer overflow after operation because it's too late.
            if (sign == 1) {
                if (num > MAXIMUM / 10 ||
                    (num == MAXIMUM / 10 && digit > MAXIMUM % 10)) {
                    return -1;
                }
            } else {
                if (-num < MINIMUM / 10 ||
                    (-num == MINIMUM / 10 && -digit < (MINIMUM % 10))) {
                    return -1;
                }
            }

            num = 10 * num + digit;
            s += 1;
        } else {
            return -2;  // Non-digit character encountered
        }
    }
    *result = sign * num;
    return 0;
}
```

## Write a generic function to swap strings and arrays.

Implement a `swap` function such that the following code

```c
int main() {
    char *h = "hell";
    char *w = "world";
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);
    // swap(h, w)
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);

    char c[5] = { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };
    char d[3] = { '1', '2', '3' };
    print_array(c, 5);
    print_array(d, 3);
    // swap(c, d)
    print_array(c, 3);
    print_array(d, 5);

    return 0;
}
```

generates the output

```
hell world
world hell
a e i o u
1 2 3
1 2 3
a e i o u
```

First, this task is _impossible_ given
[the above example code](https://stackoverflow.com/q/77162452/2641038), because the
array `c` and `d` don't have the same size. Second, `h` and `w` are two pointers (a
pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.) while `c` and `d` are
two arrays. Pointers and arrays are **not the same thing**. Third, designing a generic
swap function to swap objects of any type is doable, but for the swap to be possible,
the objects **must have the same size**. Here is the correct implementation:

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void swap_memory(void *a, void *b, size_t n) {
    char *pa = a;
    char *pb = b;
    char *end_pa = pa + n;
    while (pa != end_pa) {
        char tmp = *pa;
        *pa = *pb;
        *pb = tmp;
        pa++;
        pb++;
    }
}

void print_array(const char *c, size_t size) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        printf("%c ", c[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // NOTE: `h` is a pointer to a constant character. It means that I can't use `h` to
    // modify the characters in the string it points to, but I can reassign `h` to point
    // to a different string. Now, what does `const char *const h = "hell";` mean?
    const char *h = "hell";
    const char *w = "world"; // NOTE: "hell" and "world" do not have the same length.
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);
    swap_memory(&h, &w, sizeof(char *)); // NOTE: 32-bit or 64-bit
    printf("%s %s\n", h, w);

    char c[5] = { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };
    char d[5] = { '1', '2', '3' };
    print_array(c, 5);
    print_array(d, 3);
    swap_memory(c, d, 5); // or `(&c, &d, 5)`, doesn't matter.
    print_array(c, 3);
    print_array(d, 5);

    return 0;
}
```

## Create a function to print every elements in a 2D array.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void print_2d_array_subscript(int rows, int cols, int arr[rows][cols]);
void print_2d_array_offset(int *arr, int rows, int cols);
void print_2d_array_subscript(int rows, int cols, int arr[rows][cols]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            printf("%d ", arr[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
void print_2d_array_offset(int *arr, int rows, int cols) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *(arr + i*cols + j));
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main () {
    int arr[2][5] = {
        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
        {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
    };
    print_2d_array_offset(&arr[0][0], 2, 5);
    print_2d_array_subscript(2, 5, arr);
    return 0;
}
```

## Explain padding and alignment in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct _engineer {
    char *title;
    int age;      // 4 bytes
    long salary;  // 8 bytes
} Engineer;

typedef struct _designer {
    char *title;
    int age;      // 4 bytes
    long salary;  // 8 bytes
} __attribute__((packed)) Designer;

typedef struct _manager {
    char *title;
    short age;   // 2 Bytes
    int salary;  // 4 bytes
} Manager;

#pragma pack(push, 1)
typedef struct _sale {
    char *title;
    short age;   // 2 Bytes
    int salary;  // 4 bytes
} Sale;
#pragma pack(pop)

int main () {
    Engineer e;
    Designer d;
    Manager m;
    Sale s;
    printf("Size of Engineer is %lu. e.title: %p. e.age: %p. e.salary: %p\n", sizeof(e), &e.title, &e.age, &e.salary);
    printf("Size of Designer is %lu. d.title: %p. d.age: %p. d.salary: %p\n", sizeof(d), &d.title, &d.age, &d.salary);
    printf("Size of Manager is %lu. m.title: %p. m.age: %p. m.salary: %p\n", sizeof(m), &m.title, &m.age, &m.salary);
    printf("Size of Sale is %lu. s.title: %p. s.age: %p. s.salary: %p\n", sizeof(s), &s.title, &s.age, &s.salary);

    return 0;
}
```

shows the following output:

```
Size of Engineer is 24. e.title: 0x7fffb0d4b660. e.age: 0x7fffb0d4b668. e.salary: 0x7fffb0d4b670
Size of Designer is 20. d.title: 0x7fffb0d4b640. d.age: 0x7fffb0d4b648. d.salary: 0x7fffb0d4b64c
Size of Manager is 16. m.title: 0x7fffb0d4b630. m.age: 0x7fffb0d4b638. m.salary: 0x7fffb0d4b63c
Size of Sale is 14. s.title: 0x7fffb0d4b622. s.age: 0x7fffb0d4b62a. s.salary: 0x7fffb0d4b62c
```

The observed differences in structure sizes are due to structure padding and alignment
in C. Typically, structures are padded to align their members with the largest member's
size (in byte). In all four cases, the biggest members are all 8 bytes (char \*). Thus
all elements will be padded according 8 bytes.

-   `Engineer` Structure: To ensure salary is aligned on 8 bytes, 4 bytes of padding are
    added after `age`.
-   `Designer` Structure: The `packed` attribute ensures that there is no padding
    between structure members, potentially **reducing the overall size** of the
    structure in memory. However, note that using this attribute may result in **slower
    access times** for structure members due to the lack of alignment.
-   `Manager` Structure: 2 bytes of padding are added after `age` so that the combined
    size of `age` and `salary` aligns on 8 bytes.
-   `Sale` Structure: Padding is explicitly disabled within its scope using
    `#pragma pack(1)`.

## Create 1-Diemensional Array of pointers.

```c
int* arr[5];
printf("`arr` is an array with five pointers, and each pointer points to an interger. The address of `arr` is %p.\n", arr);
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    *(arr+i) = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
    **(arr+i) = i;
}
printf("`arr+2` means the address of the 2-th (0-based, so it's actually the third) element in arr is %p.\n", arr+2);
printf("`*(arr+2)` means that the 2-th element, which is a pointer, points to an address %p.\n",*(arr+2));
printf("`**(arr+2)` means the integer which the 2-th pointer points to is %d.\n", **(arr+2));
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    free(*(arr+i));
}
```

The output is shown below and it's pretty standard. Please explain why there is a
difference of 16 between `arr+2` and `arr`.

```
`arr` is an array with five pointers, and each pointer points to an interger. The address of `arr` is 0x7ffe971ed070.
`arr+2` means the address of the 2-th (0-based, so it's actually the third) element in arr is 0x7ffe971ed080.
`*(arr+2)` means that the 2-th element, which is a pointer, points to an address 0x55ace4c866f0.
`**(arr+2)` means the integer which the 2-th pointer points to is 2.
```

## Explain memory layout of a process.

Here is the demonstration code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int uninit_global;
int init_global = 1000;

void allocate_memory(int **arr, int size, int value)
{
    int uninit_local1 = 302;
    int init_arr[3] = {0, 1, 2};
    int uninit_local2;
    printf("<allocate_memory>:\n");
    printf("%p: init_arr\n", &init_arr);
    printf("%p: uninit_local2\n", &uninit_local2);
    printf("%p: uninit_local1\n", &uninit_local1);

    printf("%p: address of parameter `arr`\n", &arr);
    printf("%p: address of parameter `size`\n", &size);
    printf("%p: address of parameter `value`\n", &value);
    printf("\ncalling `malloc()` to allocate memory to `arr`\n");
    printf("\n===== End of Stack =====\n\n");
    printf("{Stack and Heap are growing toward each other.}\n\n");
    printf("===== End of Heap =====\n\n");

    *arr = (int *) malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    printf("%p: returned address of `malloc()`.\n", *arr);
    printf("\n");
    printf("===== Start of Heap =====\n");
}

int main () {
    int uninit_local1;
    int init_local = 302;
    int uninit_local2;

    static int static_init_local = 2380;
    static int static_uninit_local;

    printf("Here is the memory layout of a process\n\n");
    printf("===== Start of Stack =====\n\n");
    printf("<main>:\n");
    int later_defined = 10;
    int *later_defined_ptr = NULL;
    printf("%p: later_defined_ptr's address\n", &later_defined_ptr);
    printf("%p: later_defined's address\n", &later_defined);
    printf("%p: uninitialized local variable 2\n", &uninit_local2);
    printf("%p: initialized local variable\n", &init_local);
    printf("%p: uninitialized local variable 1\n", &uninit_local1);

    printf("\nCalling `allocate_memory()` function.\n");
    allocate_memory(&later_defined_ptr, 5, 45);
    printf("\n===== End of Uninitialized Data (global and static) (bss) =====\n\n");
    printf("%p: uninitialized global variable\n", &uninit_global);
    printf("%p: static uninitialized local variable\n", &static_uninit_local);
    printf("\n===== Start of Uninitialized Data (bss) =====\n");
    printf("\n===== End of Initialized Data =====\n\n");
    printf("%p: static initialized local variable\n", &static_init_local);
    printf("%p: initialized global variable\n", &init_global);
    printf("\n===== Start of Initialized Data =====\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## How to reverse byte orders from `0x12345678` to `0x78563412`?

-   Use `memcpy`:

```c
#include <stdint.h> // uint32_t, uint8_t
#include <stdio.h>  // printf
#include <stdlib.h> // malloc
#include <string.h> // memecpy

void reverse_byte_order(void *data, uint32_t num_bytes) {
    // malloc(num_bytes). calloc(num_elements, sizeof(element))
    // num_bytes = num_elements * sizeof(element)
    void *dest = malloc(num_bytes);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_bytes; ++i) {
        memcpy(dest + num_bytes - i - 1, data + i, 1);
    }
    memcpy(data, dest, num_bytes);
    free(dest);
}

int main() {
    uint32_t data1 = 0x12345678;
    printf("0x%08x\n", data1);
    reverse_byte_order(&data1, 4);
    printf("0x%08x\n", data1);

    uint32_t data2 = 0xabcdef;
    printf("0x%08x\n", data2);
    reverse_byte_order(&data2, 3);
    printf("0x%08x\n", data2);

    return 0;
}
```

-   Without using additional memory:

```c
void reverse_byte_order(void *data, uint32_t num_bytes) {
    uint8_t *start = data;
    uint8_t *end = data + num_bytes - 1;

    while (start < end) {
        // Swap the bytes pointed to by 'start' and 'end'.
        uint8_t temp = *start;
        *start = *end;
        *end = temp;

        // Move the pointers toward each other.
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

## What's the difference between `i++` and `++i`?

`i++` is known as post increment whereas `++i` is called pre increment. `++i` will
increment the value of `i`, and then return the incremented value. `i++` will increment
the value of `i`, but return the original value that `i` held before being incremented.
E.g., The following C snippet

```c
int j = 1, k = 0;
j = k++;
printf("j = %d, k = %d\n", j ,k);
j = ++k;
printf("j = %d, k = %d\n", j ,k);
```

creates the output below.

```shell
j = 0, k = 1
j = 2, k = 2
```

Let's look at some assembly code to verify that.

```c
// test.c
#include <stdio.h>
void foo() {
    int a, b;
    a = 1;

    // use one of these five at a time
    // b = a++;
    // b = ++a;
    // b = (a += 1);
    // b = (a = a + 1);
    // b = a++ + ++a;
}

int main() {
    foo();
    return 0;
}
```

One thing to keep in mind is that when a stack frame is created , it's growing toward
lower memory address. And it's guaranteed that `&b` > `&a`. So in our example, the
address `rbp-0x4` points to the variable `b` while `rbp-0x8` points to `a`. Thus, the
assignment `a = 1;` is always translated to `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1`. Now we are
ready to dive into the assembly.

-   In the case of `b = a++;`, it has the following assembly code

    ```
    $ gcc test.c && objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A10 foo.:
    0000000000001129 <foo>:
      112d:	55                   	push   rbp
      112e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
      1131:	c7 45 f8 01 00 00 00 	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1138:	8b 45 f8             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      113b:	8d 50 01             	lea    edx,[rax+0x1]
      113e:	89 55 f8             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],edx
      1141:	89 45 fc             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
      1144:	90                   	nop
    ```

    -   First, `a++` is associated to

        ```
        mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
        lea    edx,[rax+0x1]
        ```

        which first moves the value of `a` into `eax` and then computes `a+1` and moves
        the result into `edx`.

    -   Second, it moves the value of `edx` into `a`.
    -   Last, it moves the value of `eax` into `b`. Thus, `a == 1` and `b == 0` before
        `foo` returns.

-   In the case of `b = ++a;`, `b = (a += 1);`, and `b = (a += 1);`, they have the
    following assembly code

    ```
    $ gcc test.c && objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A10 foo.:
    0000000000001129 <foo>:
      112d:	55                   	push   rbp
      112e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
      1131:	c7 45 f8 01 00 00 00 	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1138:	83 45 f8 01          	add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      113c:	8b 45 f8             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      113f:	89 45 fc             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
      1142:	90                   	nop
    ```

    -   First, `++a` is associated to

        ```
        add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
        mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
        ```

        which first adds `a` with 1 and moves `a` into `eax`.

    -   Second, it moves the value of `eax` into `b`. Thus, `a == 1` and `b == 1` before
        `foo` returns. As you can see, the assembly code is one line fewer than the
        previous case. I reckon that's why people are talking about using `++i` is more
        efficient in general.

-   Finally, in the case of `b = a++ + ++a;`, its assembly code is

    ```
    $ gcc test.c && objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A12 foo.:
    0000000000001129 <foo>:
      112d:	55                   	push   rbp
      112e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
      1131:	c7 45 f8 01 00 00 00 	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1138:	8b 45 f8             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      113b:	8d 50 01             	lea    edx,[rax+0x1]
      113e:	89 55 f8             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],edx
      1141:	83 45 f8 01          	add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
      1145:	8b 55 f8             	mov    edx,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
      1148:	01 d0                	add    eax,edx
      114a:	89 45 fc             	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
      114d:	90                   	nop
    ```

    which can be broken down as follow:

    -   `a` is first moved into `eax` (Ln. 1138), added with 1 and stored in `edx`.
    -   `edx` is moved to `a` (Ln. 113e), and it adds 1 to `a` (Ln. 1141).
    -   Next, `a` is moved into `edx`. and add `edx` to `eax`.
    -   Lastly, `eax` is moved to `b`. Thus, `a == 3` and `b == 4` before `foo` returns.
        To be honest, without looking into assembly code, I am not able to answer this
        question. Thus, please DO NOT write code like this. An "intuitive" way to think
        about this is the follow
        ```
        b = a++ + ++a;
        --> 1 + (1+1)
        --> a = 3 = 2+1
        --> b = 1 + 3
        ```
        Still, it's counter intuitive.
