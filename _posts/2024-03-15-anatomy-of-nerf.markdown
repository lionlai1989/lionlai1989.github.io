Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to computer
graphics and vision for synthesizing highly realistic images from sparse sets of images.
At its core, NeRF models the continuous volumetric scene function using a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), mapping spatial coordinates and viewing directions to color and
density. In this tutorial, I aim to demystify NeRF, explaining NeRF in detail and
implementing it using PyTorch from the ground up by following [1].

# Introduction

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) use a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network, represented by
$F_{\Theta}$, where $\Theta$ denotes the network's weights, to approximate a scene as a
continuous 5D function. It does so by mapping a 5D vector, which includes a 3D spatial
coordinate $\mathbf{x} = (x, y, z)$ and a 2D viewing direction $(\theta, \phi)$, to its
associated volume density $\sigma$ and directional emitted color
$\mathbf{c} = (r, g, b)$. Typically, the viewing direction is represented as a
normalized 3D Cartesian vector $\mathbf{d}$.

The above visualization depicts the essence of NeRF. Training involves input images
coupled with corresponding pose data, a spatial coordinate $\mathbf{x}$ and viewing
direction $\mathbf{d}$, to refine an MLP. For rendering a new viewpoint, we only need to
specify a pose information. The MLP then discerns the color for the input ray.
Essentially, NeRF encodes the 3D scene within its MLP.

# Volume Rendering with Radiance Fields

NeRF encapsulates a scene by capturing both the volume density $\sigma(\mathbf{x})$ and
the directional emitted radiance at every spatial point. In this framework,
$\sigma(\mathbf{x})$ represents the differential probability of a light ray being
absorbed by an infinitesimally small particle at location $\mathbf{x}$. The expected
color $C(\mathbf{r})$ for a camera ray $\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{d}$,
confined within the bounds $t_n$ and $t_f$, is calculated as:

$$
C(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{t_n}^{t_f} T(t)\sigma(\mathbf{r}(t))\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{r}(t), \mathbf{d})dt, \quad \text{where} \quad T(t) = \exp \left( -\int_{t_n}^{t} \sigma(\mathbf{r}(s))ds \right).
$$

The elements of this equation are explained as follows:

-   $t$: the parameter along the ray, indicating the distance from the origin of the ray
    $\mathbf{o}$ to a point on its trajectory.
-   $C(\mathbf{r})$: the expected scalar color acquired by the camera ray, aggregated
    from the color contributions along the ray’s path.
-   $\sigma(\mathbf{r}(t))$: the volume density at a point on the ray, signaling the
    probability of a ray encountering a particle at that location.
-   $\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{r}(t), \mathbf{d})$: the emitted color in direction $\mathbf{d}$
    from a point on the ray, influenced by both the point's position and the viewing
    direction.
-   $T(t)$: the cumulative transmittance along the ray from $t_n$ to $t$, signifying the
    likelihood that the ray progresses from $t_n$ to $t$ without intersecting other
    particles.

To accurately evaluate the continuous integral $C(\mathbf{r})$ associated with each ray
$\mathbf{r}$ emitting from the camera center, we can discretize the ray into a series of
discrete segments. NeRF uses a stratified sampling which divides the interval
$[t_n, t_f]$—which represents the segment of the ray being considered—into $N$ equally
spaced intervals or bins. Within each bin, a sample point $t_i$ is chosen randomly,
adhering to a uniform distribution. This process is mathematically expressed as follows:

$$
t_i \sim U\left(t_n + \frac{(i - 1)}{N}(t_f - t_n), \, t_n + \frac{i}{N}(t_f - t_n)\right),
$$

where $U(a, b)$ signifies a uniform distribution between $a$ and $b$, and $i$ varies
from 1 to $N$, representing each discrete segment along the ray. The
`StratifiedRaysampler` class below implements stratified sampling with slight
modifications. Here, rays are discretized uniformly, and points are chosen uniformly,
albeit deterministically. I found this approach is also effective as well.

```python
class StratifiedRaysampler(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_pts_per_ray, min_depth, max_depth, **kwargs):
        super().__init__()

        self.n_pts_per_ray = n_pts_per_ray
        self.min_depth = min_depth
        self.max_depth = max_depth

    def forward(self, ray_bundle):
        # Compute z values for n_pts_per_ray points uniformly sampled between [near, far]
        z_vals = torch.linspace(
            start=self.min_depth, end=self.max_depth, steps=self.n_pts_per_ray
        ).to(ray_bundle.origins.device)
        z_vals = z_vals.view(
            1, -1, 1
        )  # Convert `torch.Size([n_pts_per_ray])` to `torch.Size([1, n_pts_per_ray, 1])`

        directions_view = ray_bundle.directions.view(
            -1, 1, 3
        )  # (num_rays, 3) -> (num_rays, 1, 3). No copy, just view.
        origins_view = ray_bundle.origins.view(
            -1, 1, 3
        )  # (num_rays, 3) -> (num_rays, 1, 3). No copy, just view.

        # Sample points from z values
        # (num_rays, n_pts_per_ray, 3) = (1, n_pts_per_ray, 1) * (num_rays, 1, 3) + (num_rays, 1, 3)
        sample_points = z_vals * directions_view + origins_view

        return ray_bundle._replace(
            sample_points=sample_points,
            sample_lengths=z_vals * torch.ones_like(sample_points[..., :1]),
        )
```

NeRF subsequently uses the samples $t_i$ to approximate $C(\mathbf{r})$ as follows:

$$
\hat{C}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i (1 - \exp(-\sigma_i \delta_i))\mathbf{c}_i, \quad \text{where} \quad T_i = \exp\left( -\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \sigma_j \delta_j \right)
$$

with $\delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ denoting the distance between adjacent samples. This
method for approximating $\hat{C}(\mathbf{r})$ from the set of
$(\mathbf{c}_i, \sigma_i)$ values is inherently differentiable and simplifies to
traditional alpha compositing, with alpha values
$\alpha_i = 1 - \exp(-\sigma_i \delta_i)$. The methods `_compute_weights` and
`_aggregate` within the `VolumeRenderer` class implements the functionality described
above:

```python
def _compute_weights(self, deltas, rays_density: torch.Tensor, eps: float = 1e-10):
    assert torch.all(deltas > 0)
    assert torch.all(rays_density >= 0)
    tmp_multiply = deltas * (rays_density)  # (num_rays, num_samples, 1)

    # Calculate the transmittance `T_i` along the ray for each sample point
    T_i = torch.exp(-torch.cumsum(tmp_multiply, dim=1)).to(rays_density.device)

    # Calculate weights `w_i` for each sample
    w_i = T_i * (1 - torch.exp(-tmp_multiply))  # FIXME: where is eps?
    return w_i

def _aggregate(self, weights: torch.Tensor, rays_feature: torch.Tensor):
    # Aggregate weighted sum of features using weights
    num_rays, num_samples, num_channel = rays_feature.shape
    assert weights.shape == (num_rays, num_samples, 1)

    feature = torch.sum(weights * rays_feature, dim=1)
    assert feature.shape == (num_rays, num_channel)
    return feature
```

The image above provides an overview of the NeRF scene representation and the
differentiable rendering process. Panel (a) illustrates the sampling of 5D coordinates
(comprising both location and viewing direction) along camera rays. Panel (b)
demonstrates how these inputs are fed into an MLP to generate color and volume density.
In (c), volume rendering techniques are applied to composite these outputs into an image
(recall the meaning of $\hat{C}(\mathbf{r})$). This rendering process is inherently
differentiable, enabling the optimization of the scene representation by minimizing the
discrepancy between synthesized images and ground truth observations, as shown in (d).

_Note:_ In traditional alpha compositing, alpha values range from 0 to 1, representing a
pixel's transparency level. An alpha of 1 indicates full opacity, while an alpha of 0
signifies complete transparency. In the context of NeRF, the alpha value is derived from
the volume density $\sigma_i$ at a specific sample point and the distance $\delta_i$ to
the subsequent sample along a ray. A higher product of $\sigma_i$ and $\delta_i$ implies
a denser medium. Given that both $\sigma_i$ and $\delta_i$ are positive, the expression
$\exp(-\sigma_i \delta_i)$ naturally falls within the [0, 1] range. Therefore,
$\alpha_i = 1 - \exp(-\sigma_i \delta_i)$ effectively translates a greater combination
of volume density and sample distance into increased alpha.

# NeRF's Model Architecture

The overall fully-connected network architecture of NeRF is shown below.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <br>A visualization of NeRF's fully-connected network. The image is adapted from [1].
        <i></i>
    </div>
</div>

The architecture is detailed as follows: Inputs (green) flow through hidden layers
(blue) to outputs (red), with block numbers indicating vector dimensions. It uses
standard fully-connected layers composed of ReLU activations (black arrows), layers
without activations (orange arrows), and sigmoid activations (dashed black arrows).
Vector concatenation is represented by "+". Positional encoding $\gamma(\mathbf{x})$
passes through eight 256-channel ReLU layers, including a skip connection at the fifth
layer. Up to the point marked by the orange arrow, the model is encapsulated as
`MLPWithInputSkips`, detailed below:

```python
class MLPWithInputSkips(torch.nn.Module):
    """Implement Figure 7 from [Mildenhall et al. 2020], an MLP with a skip connection."""

    def __init__(
        self, n_layers, input_dim, output_dim, skip_dim, hidden_dim, input_skips
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self._input_skips = set(input_skips)

        layers = []
        for i in range(n_layers):
            # The first and last layer can also be skip layer.
            dimin = input_dim if i == 0 else hidden_dim  # first layer
            dimout = output_dim if i == n_layers - 1 else hidden_dim  # last layer
            if i in self._input_skips:
                dimin += skip_dim

            linear = torch.nn.Linear(dimin, dimout)

            if i < n_layers - 1:
                layers.append(torch.nn.Sequential(linear, torch.nn.ReLU(inplace=True)))
            elif i == n_layers - 1:  # Last layer has no activation
                layers.append(torch.nn.Sequential(linear))

        self._mlp = torch.nn.ModuleList(layers)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor, skip_pos: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # NOTE: Python is pass-by-reference, torch.Tensor is mutable and `ReLU(inplace=True)`.
        # Does the following code have any UNEXPEXTED side effect when `x is skip_pos`?
        # tmp_id = id(skip_pos)
        for i, layer in enumerate(self._mlp):
            if i in self._input_skips:
                x = torch.cat((x, skip_pos), dim=-1)
            x = layer(x)
        # assert tmp_id == id(skip_pos)
        return x
```

In `forward`, passing identical `torch.Tensor` `v` as both `x` and `skip_pos`, such as
`MLPWithInputSkips()(v, v)`, results in `x` and `skip_pos` sharing the same `id` as `v`.
Despite using `ReLU(inplace=True)`, `x` is not overwritten; instead, Python generates a
new object for `x` at each `x = layer(x)` operation, preserving the original `v` and
`skip_pos`. I am not sure how to explain this behaviour but record the result here.

Following the previous layers, a subsequent layer outputs non-negative volume density
$\sigma$ (via ReLU) and a 256-dimensional feature vector. This vector, when concatenated
with $\gamma(\mathbf{d})$, undergoes further processing by a 128-channel ReLU layer. A
sigmoid-activated final layer outputs RGB radiance at $\mathbf{x}$ for direction
$\mathbf{d}$. The `NeuralRadianceField` class implements this process as follows:

```python
class NeuralRadianceField(torch.nn.Module):
    """Implement NeRF."""

    def __init__(self, cfg):
        super().__init__()
        self.harmonic_embedding_xyz = HarmonicEmbedding(3, cfg.n_harmonic_functions_xyz)
        self.harmonic_embedding_dir = HarmonicEmbedding(3, cfg.n_harmonic_functions_dir)

        embedding_dim_xyz = (
            self.harmonic_embedding_xyz.output_dim
        )  # 3 * n_harmonic_functions_xyz * 2
        embedding_dim_dir = (
            self.harmonic_embedding_dir.output_dim
        )  # 3 * n_harmonic_functions_dir * 2

        self.xyz_out_layer = MLPWithInputSkips(
            n_layers=cfg.n_layers_xyz,
            input_dim=embedding_dim_xyz,
            output_dim=cfg.n_hidden_neurons_xyz,
            skip_dim=embedding_dim_xyz,
            hidden_dim=cfg.n_hidden_neurons_xyz,
            input_skips=cfg.append_xyz,
        )
        self.density_out_layer = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(cfg.n_hidden_neurons_xyz, 1),
            torch.nn.ReLU(inplace=True),  # ensure density being nonnegative
        )
        self.feature_vector = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(cfg.n_hidden_neurons_xyz, cfg.n_hidden_neurons_xyz),
            torch.nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
        )

        self.rgb_out_layer = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(
                embedding_dim_dir + cfg.n_hidden_neurons_xyz, cfg.n_hidden_neurons_dir
            ),
            torch.nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            torch.nn.Linear(cfg.n_hidden_neurons_dir, 3),
            torch.nn.Sigmoid(),  # (r, g, b) in [0, 1]
        )

    def forward(self, ray_bundle):  # ray_bundle: (num_rays, )
        pos = ray_bundle.sample_points  # (num_rays, n_pts_per_ray, 3)
        dir = ray_bundle.directions  # (num_rays, 3)
        position_encoding = self.harmonic_embedding_xyz(pos)
        direction_encoding = self.harmonic_embedding_dir(dir)
        # tmp = position_encoding.clone()
        xyz_out = self.xyz_out_layer(position_encoding, position_encoding)
        # assert torch.equal(position_encoding, tmp)
        density = self.density_out_layer(xyz_out)
        feature = self.feature_vector(xyz_out)

        expanded_direction_encoding = direction_encoding.unsqueeze(1).repeat(
            1, feature.shape[1], 1
        )  # (num_rays, 24) --> (num_rays, 1, 24) --> (num_rays, n_pts_per_ray, 24)

        # Concatenate feature and expanded_direction_encoding
        rgb = self.rgb_out_layer(
            torch.cat([feature, expanded_direction_encoding], dim=-1)
        )

        return {"density": density, "feature": rgb}
```

The network outputs a dictionary comprising two components: a density value $\sigma$ and
a feature vector representing color $\mathbf{c} = (r, g, b)$.

## Position Encoding

According to [1], input coordinates undergo transformation into a higher-dimensional
space through the function $\gamma$. This enhances the network's capacity to capture
high-frequency variations. The transformation $\gamma(p)$ for each coordinate is as
follows:

$$
\gamma(p) = (\sin(2^0 \pi p), \cos(2^0 \pi p), ..., \sin(2^{L-1} \pi p), \cos(2^{L-1} \pi p)).
$$

The `HarmonicEmbedding` class implements the $\gamma(p)$ function, detailed as follows:

```python
class HarmonicEmbedding(torch.nn.Module):
    """Implement position encoding in NeRF."""

    def __init__(
        self, in_channels: int = 3, n_harmonic_functions: int = 6, omega0: float = 1.0
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__()

        frequencies = 2.0 ** torch.arange(n_harmonic_functions, dtype=torch.float32)
        self.register_buffer("_frequencies", omega0 * frequencies, persistent=False)
        self.output_dim = n_harmonic_functions * 2 * in_channels

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):
        embed = (x[..., None] * self._frequencies).view(*x.shape[:-1], -1)
        return torch.cat((embed.sin(), embed.cos()), dim=-1)
```

The function $\gamma(\cdot)$ is applied to each component of the spatial coordinates
$\mathbf{x}$ and the Cartesian viewing direction vector $\mathbf{d}$, with both
normalized within $[-1, 1]$. As specified in [1], $\gamma(\mathbf{x})$ uses $L=10$ and
$\gamma(\mathbf{d})$ uses $L=4$. Consequently, given the calculations `3x10x2=60` for
$\gamma(\mathbf{x})$ and `3x4x2=24` for $\gamma(\mathbf{d})$, these dimensions, 60 and
24 respectively, are illustrated in the model's architectural diagram.

## Hierarchical Volume Sampling

Work in progress.

## Depth vs. Inverse-Depth Sampling

Work in progress.

## Defining Loss

In [1], the method involves randomly sampling batches of camera rays from pixel data and
applying hierarchical sampling to collect $N_c$ samples via a "coarse" network and
$N_c + N_f$ samples through a "fine" network. As hierarchical volume sampling is
currently under development, I will focus solely on the loss function excluding
hierarchical volume sampling aspects. Hence, the loss is defined as the total squared
error between the rendered colors from the coarse renderings and the actual pixel
colors:

$$
L = \sum_{\mathbf{r} \in R} \left( \| \hat{C}_c(\mathbf{r}) - C(\mathbf{r}) \|^2_2 \right),
$$

where $R$ is the set of sampled rays, and $C(\mathbf{r})$ and $\hat{C}_c(\mathbf{r})$
denote the ground truth and coarse predicted colors for ray $\mathbf{r}$, respectively.

# Experimentation Results

In this section, I evaluate my NeRF implementation using three datasets: "Lego", "Fern",
